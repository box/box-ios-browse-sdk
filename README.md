Developer Setup
---------------
* Ensure you have the latest version of [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.
* We encourage you to use [Cocoa Pods](http://cocoapods.org/) to import the SDK into your project. Cocoa Pods is a simple, but powerful dependency management tool. If you do not already use Cocoa Pods, it's very easy to [get started](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

Quickstart
----------
Step 1: Add to your Podfile
```
pod 'box-ios-browse-sdk'
```
Step 2: Install
```
pod install
```
Step 3: Import
```objectivec
#import <BoxBrowseSDK/BoxBrowseSDK.h>
#import <BoxContentSDK/BOXContentSDK.h>
```
Step 4: Set the Box Client ID and Client Secret that you obtain from [creating a developer account](http://developers.box.com/)
```objectivec
[BOXContentClient setClientID:@"your-client-id" clientSecret:@"your-client-secret"];
```
Step 5: Launch a BOXFolderViewController
```objectivec
BOXContentClient *contentClient = [BOXContentClient defaultClient];
BOXFolderViewController *folderViewController = [[BOXFolderViewController alloc] initWithContentClient:contentClient];

// You must push it to a UINavigationController (i.e. do not 'presentViewController')
UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:folderViewController];
[self presentViewController:navigationController animated:YES completion:nil];
```

Sample App
----------
A sample app can be found in the [BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp](../../tree/master/BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp) folder. To execute the sample app:
Step 1: Install Pods
```
cd BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp
pod install
```
Step 2: Open Workspace
```
open BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp.xcworkspace
```
