Box iOS Browse SDK
===================

##Note:

- The Box iOS Browse SDK is in **Maintenance** mode. This means only critical bugs will be patched. However, new functionality and additional bug fixes may be added on occasion based on customer demand, but should not be expected.

This SDK allows you to show UI that allows users to browse their folders on Box.

Developer Setup
---------------
 * Ensure you have the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.
 * We encourage you to use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to import the SDK into your project.

Quickstart
----------
Step 1: Setup Carthage
```
brew install carthage
```
Create Cartfile in your project directory, add the following line:
```
 git "git@github.com:box/box-ios-browse-sdk.git" "master"
```
This will fetch the latest commit on master branch.

Step 2: Run Carthage Update

In the same directory as your Cartfile, run the following command:
```
carthage update --platform ios
```
Step 3: Import

In your project:

```objectivec
@import BoxBrowseSDK;
```

Step 4: Set the Box Client ID and Client Secret that you obtain from [creating a developer account](http://developers.box.com/)
```objectivec
[BOXContentClient setClientID:@"your-client-id" clientSecret:@"your-client-secret"];
```
Step 5: Launch a BOXFolderViewController
```objectivec
BOXContentClient *contentClient = [BOXContentClient defaultClient];
BOXFolderViewController *folderViewController = [[BOXFolderViewController alloc] initWithContentClient:contentClient];

// You must push it to a UINavigationController (i.e. do not 'presentViewController')
UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:folderViewController];
[self presentViewController:navigationController animated:YES completion:nil];
```

Sample App
----------
A sample app can be found in the [BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp](../../tree/master/BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp) folder. To execute the sample app:
Step 1: Update Carthage
```
cd BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp
carthage update --platform iOS
```
Step 2: Open Workspace
```
open BoxBrowseSDKSampleApp.xcworkspace
```
